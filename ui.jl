#=
A DEB plant user-interface. This allows manual construction
and parametrisation of the DEB plant model, run with forcing 
variables from microclimate data.

You can swap out any model components by selecting them from the dropdowns
and hitting the "Reload" button. It should give you an updated set of sliders
to control the new model with.

Giving the model a name and hitting save will save the load script for the model in the
models folder. This will be available next time you load the ui.
If you use an existing name, it will be written over.

If the plot is white initially, just click a flux or vars 
check box to make it build.

WARNING: this will take a while to load.
